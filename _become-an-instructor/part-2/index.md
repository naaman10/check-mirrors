## The Part 2 driving test.

This test is to show your driving skills and ability. It’s a stricter test than a learner test lasting up to one hour. Your trainer will asses your driving and advise you on the areas that may need to be improved upon as let’s face it everyone picks up bad habits once they’ve passed their learner test especially if they’ve been driving a long time. This is something though you can practice by yourself when you’re driving from A to B.

It depends on where you live as to where you take your test as normally the examiner will want to see you drive on a motorway as well as other road types.

If you fail don’t worry, a bit more homework may be needed and you have 2 more attempts at passing.
