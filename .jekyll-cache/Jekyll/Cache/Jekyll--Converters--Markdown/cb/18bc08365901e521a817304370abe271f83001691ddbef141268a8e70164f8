<p>The Part 1 test is your first step to becoming a driving instructor.</p>

<p>It’s a theory and hazard perception test but harder than the Learner Theory Test.</p>

<p>Before you sit the Learner Theory Test you will need to complete a Disclosure and Barring Service <a href="https://www.gov.uk/criminal-record-check-become-driving-instructor?step-by-step-nav=80bd32e4-9708-4214-bc0f-50358223bb09">(DBS)</a>, and then complete your application to become a trainee driving instructor with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-to-become-a-driving-instructor">DVSA</a>.</p>

<h3 id="learner-theory-test-part-1">Learner Theory Test Part 1</h3>

<p>There are 2 parts to the test.</p>

<p>First is a multiple-choice test where you have to get an overall score of 85 out of 100 and at least 20 out of 25 in each of the four categories.</p>

<p>Second is the hazard perception test where you watch a selection of videos and spot the hazard by clicking on a mouse. To pass the hazard perception test you need to score at least 57 points out of 75.</p>

<h2 id="the-test">The Test</h2>

<p>Both tests are taken at the same time and you have to pass both together, you can’t pass one and then resit the second.</p>

<p>It costs £81 and if you fail you can rebook it, but, with the correct study materials and lots of homework it’s very doable.</p>

<p>When you’re ready to sit your test, you can book it directly with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/book-your-instructor-theory-test">DVSA website</a>.</p>
