I donâ€™t think â€œthanksâ€ is enough to convey the level of appreciation Iâ€™m feeling right now, but the contribution of tough love, honest feedback and patience was just what I needed to pass.
Thanks so much for everything. Iâ€™d recommend the company and my instructor particularly to anyone looking to learn or just refreshâ€</p>
