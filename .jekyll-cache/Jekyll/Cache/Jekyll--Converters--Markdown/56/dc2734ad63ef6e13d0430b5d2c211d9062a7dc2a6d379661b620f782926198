<p>The Part 3 is designed to test your ability to instruct a learner driver. There are 17 areas on which you will be marked.</p>

<p>They are made up of three categories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lesson Planning</li>
  <li>Risk Management</li>
  <li>Teaching and Learning Strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be marked from 0 to 3 on each of the 17 areas, this will all add to your final score.</p>

<p>You have to have 40 hours of training then are two ways to go from then. You can apply for your Part 3 test, or, apply for a Pink trainee license. Most instructors/ADIâ€™s will agree the trainee license is the best way to go as you can train, build up your confidence and knowledge and have a better chance of passing your Part 3 test whilst also earning some money.</p>

<p>Like your Part 3 you have 3 attempts to pass otherwise youâ€™ll have to start again and take your theory test</p>
