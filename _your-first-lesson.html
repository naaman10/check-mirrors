<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>Getting behind the wheel for your first driving lesson might seem quite daunting, but do not worry â€“ no-one is expecting you to drive off onto a busy road the first time you get behind the wheel.</p>

<p>It is normal to be nervous ahead of your first driving lesson. We have prepared a handy guide on what to expect from your first lesson and how to make sure you are prepared for it.</p>

<h2>How to Prepare for your First Driving Lesson?</h2>
<p>For your first driving lesson, it is important to bring your provisional driving license with you. Your Bill Plant Driving Instructor will ask you for this document and will need to see it before he/she is legally allowed to give you any driving lessons.</p>


It is also important to make sure you have dressed appropriately for your first driving lesson. This is mainly for your choice of footwear. Having comfortable, flat sole shoes is advised to take any driving lesson.

Remember your Glasses
Your Driving Instructor must ensure that your eyesight is in line with minimum Driving Standards Agency eyesight standards and might ask you to read a nearby vehicle registration plate before the driving lesson can go any further. This means being able to read a vehicle number plate in clear daylight (with your corrective lenses if you wear them) from 20.5 meters away.
