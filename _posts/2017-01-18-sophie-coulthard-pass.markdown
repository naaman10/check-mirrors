"Driving with Sarah made learning to drive both a fun and calm experience. From coming from another instructor after months of driving with hardly any improvement, Sarah helped build my confidence and enabled me to see improvement week on week so that in 4 months I went from not been able to start without stalling, to passing my test.
Overall a great experience, with lessons being structured and well planned In advance"
