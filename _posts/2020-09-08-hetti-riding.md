Congratulations to Hetti Riding, York, who passed today first time with 9 minors.

“I would recommend Sarah at Checkmirrors to anyone learning to drive in York. She really helped me get over my nervousness on the road and made me such a better driver - I passed my test first time! She was such a cheerleader the whole way through and is a great instructor - thanks Sarah”

Well done Hetti, safe driving.
