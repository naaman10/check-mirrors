“Sarah is amazing! Having started with another instructor, I was still very nervous behind the wheel. Sarah made me feel at ease immediately and has really built my confidence every lesson. She not only made me feel safe and secure in lessons, but made them fun too and she turned driving into something I genuinely enjoy. I would recommend Sarah and Checkmirrors to anybody looking for an instructor - especially if you have some nerves on the road!”
