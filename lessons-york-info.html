        <h2>Before you learn</h2>
        <p>You must obtain a UK Provisional Driving License before you can start your driving lessons, sit the Theory Test or take your Practical Driving Test.<p>
        <p>Get your first Provisional Driving License for a car from either the DVLA website <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-provisional-driving-licence" target="_blank">www.gov.uk</a> (£34) or from a post office completing a D1 form (£43).</p>
        <p>It’s worth knowing that online applications are £9 cheaper than applying via post, but everyone should be aware to <b>only apply online</b> using the real GOV.UK as there are many FRAUDULENT BOOKING WEBSITES out there!</p>
        <p>To apply you must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be a resident of Great Britain</li>
          <li>be at least 17 years old (you can apply 3 months before your 17th birthday)</li>
          <li>be able to read a number plate from <u>20 metres</u> away</li>
          <li>have a valid passport or another form of identity</li>
          <li>provide addresses of where you have lived over the last 3 years</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your license should arrive in one week if you apply online. It may take longer if the DVLA need to make additional checks.</p>
        <p>ONCE YOU RECEIVE YOUR LICENSE YOUR READY TO START YOUR DRIVING LESSONS</p>
