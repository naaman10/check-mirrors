- instructor_name: Paul Reynolds
  instructor_info: ''
  instructor_bio: I have a passion for safe and professional driving due to being
    an Ambulance driver in the past. This profession trained and drilled into me how
    to drive in any situation safely and calmly. Then I moved on to an IT career which
    I have been in for the last 23 years. I have now decided to pass on my passion
    and experience and become a driving instructor. With my new car, which is a Tesla
    Model 3 automatic, I believe electric is the way forward for the environment and
    also in terms of safety as cars are been designed to be smarter with all the new
    technology. I was highly recommended Checkmirrors as a driving school due to their
    high standards which I have witnessed from the company's instructors.
