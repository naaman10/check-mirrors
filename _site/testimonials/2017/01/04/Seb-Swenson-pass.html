I don’t think “thanks” is enough to convey the level of appreciation I’m feeling right now, but the contribution of tough love, honest feedback and patience was just what I needed to pass.
Thanks so much for everything. I’d recommend the company and my instructor particularly to anyone looking to learn or just refresh”</p>
