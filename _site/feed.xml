        <title>Congratulations to Rebecca Chaulkley, York who passed today first time with only 2 minors.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Really enjoyed my lessons with Ryan. Lessons were always well planned and I would leave them feeling like I was making progress each time. Ryan is also a really friendly and calm person which was a massive help”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well done Rebecca, safe driving.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Congratulations to Lucy Ross, York who passed first time today with just 6 minors.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Sarah is amazing! Having started with another instructor, I was still very nervous behind the wheel. Sarah made me feel at ease immediately and has really built my confidence every lesson. She not only made me feel safe and secure in lessons, but made them fun too and she turned driving into something I genuinely enjoy. I would recommend Sarah and Checkmirrors to anybody looking for an instructor - especially if you have some nerves on the road!”&lt;/p&gt;
