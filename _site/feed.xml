        <title>Congratulations Kylie from Tadcaster who passed with Rob</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“I enjoyed my driving lessons with Rob. I had another driving instructor before him and rob was so much better because at the end of every lesson he would give me a debrief on how it went what I need to practice next. But he never made me feel bad about my driving. So I would definitely recommend him to others.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Sarah has been fantastic. After going through at least 5 other different instructors, I instantly knew Sarah was a keeper!

        <title>Congratulations to Sophie Coulthard who passed first time with Sarah.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Driving with Sarah made learning to drive both a fun and calm experience. From coming from another instructor after months of driving with hardly any improvement, Sarah helped build my confidence and enabled me to see improvement week on week so that in 4 months I went from not been able to start without stalling, to passing my test.
Overall a great experience, with lessons being structured and well planned In advance”&lt;/p&gt;
