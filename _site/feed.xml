        <title>Congratulations to Lucy Ross, York who passed first time today with just 6 minors.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Sarah is amazing! Having started with another instructor, I was still very nervous behind the wheel. Sarah made me feel at ease immediately and has really built my confidence every lesson. She not only made me feel safe and secure in lessons, but made them fun too and she turned driving into something I genuinely enjoy. I would recommend Sarah and Checkmirrors to anybody looking for an instructor - especially if you have some nerves on the road!”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Congratulations Kylie from Tadcaster who passed with Rob</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“I enjoyed my driving lessons with Rob. I had another driving instructor before him and rob was so much better because at the end of every lesson he would give me a debrief on how it went what I need to practice next. But he never made me feel bad about my driving. So I would definitely recommend him to others.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Sarah has been fantastic. After going through at least 5 other different instructors, I instantly knew Sarah was a keeper!
