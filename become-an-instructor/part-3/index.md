## The final test to take to become an instructor.

The Part 3 is designed to test your ability to instruct a learner driver. There are 17 areas on which you will be marked.

They are made up of three categories.

* Lesson Planning
* Risk Management
* Teaching and Learning Strategies

You will be marked from 0 to 3 on each of the 17 areas, this will all add to your final score.

You have to have 40 hours of training then are two ways to go from then. You can apply for your Part 3 test, or, apply for a Pink trainee license. Most instructors/ADI’s will agree the trainee license is the best way to go as you can train, build up your confidence and knowledge and have a better chance of passing your Part 3 test whilst also earning some money.

Like your Part 3 you have 3 attempts to pass otherwise you'll have to start again and take your theory test
