## Information for your Part 1 test.

The Part 1 test is your first step to becoming a driving instructor.

It’s a theory and hazard perception test but harder than the Learner Theory Test.

Before you sit the Learner Theory Test you will need to complete a Disclosure and Barring Service [(DBS)](https://www.gov.uk/criminal-record-check-become-driving-instructor?step-by-step-nav=80bd32e4-9708-4214-bc0f-50358223bb09), and then complete your application to become a trainee driving instructor with the [DVSA](https://www.gov.uk/apply-to-become-a-driving-instructor).

### Learner Theory Test Part 1

There are 2 parts to the test.

First is a multiple-choice test where you have to get an overall score of 85 out of 100 and at least 20 out of 25 in each of the four categories.

### Learner Theory Test Part 2

Second is the hazard perception test where you watch a selection of videos and spot the hazard by clicking on a mouse. To pass the hazard perception test you need to score at least 57 points out of 75.

## The Test

Both tests are taken at the same time and you have to pass both together, you can’t pass one and then resit the second.

It costs £81 and if you fail you can rebook it, but, with the correct study materials and lots of homework it’s very doable.

When you're ready to sit your test, you can book it directly with the [DVSA website](https://www.gov.uk/book-your-instructor-theory-test).
