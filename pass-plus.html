  title: Why PassPlus?
  text: |-
    PassPlus is an excellent way for new or experienced drivers to expand their driving skills and become a better all-round driver.

    The syllabus covers driving in different weather conditions and teaches you to understand how the changing conditions impact how you drive and teaches you vital skills for driving on different types of roads like driving in the city to driving on the motorway.

    What's more, drivers with a PassPlus certificate under their belt also benefit from lower insurance premiums. Insurers see those with PassPlus as more competent and trustworthy drivers, resulting in a lower premium. A real plus for new young drivers often stung with high insurance costs.
